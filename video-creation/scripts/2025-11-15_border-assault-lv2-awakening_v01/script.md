# Border Assault Lv.2 Awakening Script Draft

## Logline
At the border settlement, Yecheng harnesses Curve Bolt Lv.2's multi-track control to repel a surge of bone beasts and unlocks a mysterious debugger privilege mid-battle.

## Beat Notes
1. Dusk over the wooden palisade: scouts sight flickering green lights beyond the muddy flats while alarms toll.
2. Ground-level rush with the first wave of bone beasts trampling mud, bone plates glinting under the circuit-lit sky.
3. Impact sequence as beasts slam the fence and standard bolts fizzle against armor while civilians scramble behind the line.
4. Yecheng sprints toward a collapsing gap, HUD priming warnings as he weaves through panicked allies.
5. First-person HUD overlay: Curve Bolt Lv.2 multi-track mode prompt, tactical map with friendly/enemy pings.
6. Yecheng sketches golden trajectories mid-air, routing around allies and structures toward multiple beast vitals.
7. Eight targets lock simultaneously; HUD enumerates locks as status text updates.
8. Volley launch: curved bolts snake through alleys, brushing walls and allies to strike invading beasts.
9. Two bolts thread tight urban corridors, saving civilians and finishing beasts with precise arcs.
10. Oversized beast breaches; emergency trajectory hugs the ground before piercing its jaw and spine.
11. Battlefield slows as beasts fall; HUD dims to reveal a debugger privilege activation prompt.
12. Extreme close-up on Yecheng's eye reflecting `/compiler_log` as he questions his role amid the frozen chaos.
