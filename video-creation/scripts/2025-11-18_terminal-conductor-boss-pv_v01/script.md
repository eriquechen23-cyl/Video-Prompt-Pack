## One-Sentence Concept

A 15-second live-action boss PV unveils the Terminal Conductor who guards a mapless underground terminus—progressing from quiet discovery, to rule-bound confrontation, to a half-train execution form that reenacts his final disaster.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Lost Platform Approach (Phase 1 Foreshadow)
- **Beat**: Vanishing Map Entry — Phone map shows no station as camera lowers to reveal the wet concrete terminal.
  - **Visual Intent**: 35mm handheld push-in from screen glare to deserted platform.
  - **Audio Intent**: Filtered subway rumble with muffled notification buzz fading out.
- **Beat**: First Step Echo — Protagonist shoes splash into puddle beside discarded timetables.
  - **Visual Intent**: 50mm macro on water ripple and paper fragments.
  - **Audio Intent**: Emphasize squeak, distant drip, rolling thunder.
- **Beat**: Conductor Backlit — Terminal Conductor stands at track edge backlit by a lonely sodium lamp.
  - **Visual Intent**: 75mm telephoto compression, silhouette framed by fluorescent flicker.
  - **Audio Intent**: Ghosted PA hum, low metallic groan.
- **Beat**: Cracked Pocket Watch — Insert on silver watch frozen at 00:01.
  - **Visual Intent**: Macro rack focus along cracked glass, breath condensing.
  - **Audio Intent**: Stuttering tick, heartbeat sub-layer.

### Act II – Timetable Verdict (Phase 1 Dialogue + Trigger)
- **Beat**: Ticket Warning Line — Conductor delivers line “Your ticket only goes this far.”
  - **Visual Intent**: Two-shot, conductor half-turned, service-smile tension.
  - **Audio Intent**: Intimate reverb, low-end rumble ducking.
- **Beat**: Light Malfunction — Fluorescent tubes strobe, phantom rails glow.
  - **Visual Intent**: Ceiling whip-pan, orange edge lights trace platform lip.
  - **Audio Intent**: Electrical arcing, distant brake screech.
- **Beat**: Whistle Shriek — Conductor lifts whistle; blast becomes rail-grind siren.
  - **Visual Intent**: Chest close-up with condensation and vibrating cord.
  - **Audio Intent**: High-frequency shriek, platform reverb.
- **Beat**: Metal Bloom — Lower body begins rail-to-wheel transformation.
  - **Visual Intent**: 28mm low-angle tilt; trousers tear revealing glowing axle.
  - **Audio Intent**: Metal stretch, magnetic snap pulses.

### Act III – Phase 2 Assault (Half-Train Execution)
- **Beat**: Headlight Eyes — Eyes flood with headlamp beams.
  - **Visual Intent**: Extreme eye macro, reflection of charging train.
  - **Audio Intent**: Horn swell merging with breath.
- **Beat**: Rail Dash — Conductor skates along conjured rails spraying sparks.
  - **Visual Intent**: 35mm lateral tracking, phantom rails above ground.
  - **Audio Intent**: Wheel whine, showering sparks, Doppler slam.
- **Beat**: Accident Reenactment — Space shifts into blackout as runaway train barrels toward camera.
  - **Visual Intent**: Wide POV showing ghost train and conductor question overlay.
  - **Audio Intent**: Layered crowd panics, PA loop “Doors closing?” question.
- **Beat**: Final Gaze & Logo — Light dies in eyes; hard cut to title card.
  - **Visual Intent**: Slow push-in to stare then smash cut logo.
  - **Audio Intent**: Watch tick single hit followed by silence.

## Character & Scene Roster

- **Terminal Conductor** — Pale 40s male in worn navy conductor uniform, cracked pocket watch, whistle that shrieks like brakes; transforms with metal rails growing from legs and LED route ghosts.
- **Lost Passenger POV** — Implied protagonist; no clear face, just footsteps and handheld framing to keep viewer stand-in.
- **Key Location**: Ghost terminal with wet concrete floors, flickering fluorescent strips, phantom LED signage (“終點/回送/Not in Service”).
- **Signature Props**: Conductor hat with corroded badge, cracked pocket watch, whistle, phantom rails, LED signage, spectral train headlamps.

## Visual Language & Style Notes

- Anchor imagery in Real Cinema Look: cool steel blues with sodium orange kicks, shallow depth of field, damp sheen surfaces.
- Maintain Terminal Station Specter layer: lens flares from moisture, ghost rails extruded via volumetric light, LED signage glitching with bilingual text.
- Keep conductor posture upright except micro-forward lean near tracks; transformation uses practical metal plates augmented by subtle VFX.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Primary focal lengths per Real Cinema Lens Set: 35mm establishing, 50mm dialogue, 75mm inserts; occasional 28mm low-angle hero shot.
- Dolly/slider glides for approach, limited handheld (<3%) to show tension in POV beats.
- Shutter 180° baseline; extend to 200° for rail sparks to elongate trails; drop to 144° during strobing lights for crispness.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- PA voice inspired by bilingual station announcements layered with analog hiss.
- Music bed: low BPM (80) percussive pulses with subterranean drones; escalate to industrial hits during transformation.
- Signature FX: whistle-shriek mapped to metal brake scrapes, phantom rails hum panned left-right, watch tick used as sting for time freezes.

## Pace & Timing Grid

- 00:03.6–00:04.8 — Cracked Pocket Watch.
- 00:04.8–00:06.0 — Ticket Warning Line.
- 00:06.0–00:07.2 — Light Malfunction.
- 00:07.2–00:08.4 — Whistle Shriek.
- 00:08.4–00:09.6 — Metal Bloom.
- 00:09.6–00:10.8 — Headlight Eyes.
- 00:10.8–00:12.0 — Rail Dash.
- 00:12.0–00:13.2 — Accident Reenactment.
- 00:13.2–00:15.0 — Final Gaze & Logo.

## Safety & Compliance Checklist

- Follow Real Cinema Safety Checklist: avoid legible signage beyond invented symbols, keep pedestrians nonexistent, preserve natural skin textures.
- Moisture and sparks must be simulated without exposing real electrical hazards; highlight that environment is controlled set.
- Record LUT choice and phantom rail particle seeds for reproducibility; ensure bilingual signage stays fictional.
