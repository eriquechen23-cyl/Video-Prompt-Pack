## One-Sentence Concept

A soft-spoken human summons their grey-blue cat 米漿 out of the apartment shadows with whispered nicknames that spark a gentle light ritual before the reunion cuddle.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Whispered Invocation
- **Beat**: Lamp Alone — Establish the dim room with only one warm lamp burning, light pooling on wooden floor.
  - **Visual Intent**: Locked medium framing to contrast the golden spill with surrounding darkness.
  - **Audio Intent**: Barely-there HVAC hum and distant city hush.
- **Beat**: Edge of the Light — Reveal the human seated at the light’s edge, palms up, fingertips quivering.
  - **Visual Intent**: Slight top-side angle to show figure encircled by darkness.
  - **Audio Intent**: Cloth rustle from subtle breathing shifts.
- **Beat**: Glow in the Palms — Tight focus on the warm glimmer rising beneath the skin.
  - **Visual Intent**: Macro pull-in on hands with internal light bloom.
  - **Audio Intent**: Small inhalation cue to begin the ritual.
- **Beat**: Whispered Roll Call — Mouth close-up forming the nicknames-turned-incantation.
  - **Visual Intent**: Lips near mic, catching condensation of each soft syllable.
  - **Audio Intent**: Whispered “米漿、小圓球、臭小孩……” with gentle room reverb.

### Act II – Names Become Light
- **Beat**: Lines of Gold — Every whispered name etches a thin golden line along the floor.
  - **Visual Intent**: Follow glowing strokes knitting a circle across wood grain.
  - **Audio Intent**: Delicate sparkles layered with swelling hum.
- **Beat**: Circle Completed — Overhead reveal of the sigil featuring paw-pad motif.
  - **Visual Intent**: Slow rotating top shot of the glowing circle.
  - **Audio Intent**: Faint electric buzz almost inaudible.
- **Beat**: Snap Trigger — Fingers snap above the circle to seal the summon.
  - **Visual Intent**: Close on hand flick and snap highlight.
  - **Audio Intent**: Crisp snap echoing in the quiet.
- **Beat**: Stirring Shadows — Camera pans to cardboard boxes where shadows ripple.
  - **Visual Intent**: Medium shot catching subtle vibration in the dark corner.
  - **Audio Intent**: Paper shuffle and low “shff” texture.

### Act III – 米漿 Returns
- **Beat**: Ears First — Low angle as 米漿’s ears and head emerge from the dark.
  - **Visual Intent**: Focus on ear silhouette before eyes adjust.
  - **Audio Intent**: Soft sniff and fur shift.
- **Beat**: Steps into Light — Follow 米漿’s paws padding from shadow to glow.
  - **Visual Intent**: Ground-level tracking on paws catching lamp shimmer.
  - **Audio Intent**: Gentle “da, da, da” paw rhythm.
- **Beat**: Scent Check — 米漿 sits within the sigil, sniffs the waiting palm.
  - **Visual Intent**: Mid-close on cat and hand meeting within light circle.
  - **Audio Intent**: Purr onset entwined with inquisitive sniff.
- **Beat**: Soothed Reunion — Human strokes 米漿’s back while the cat yawns and relaxes.
  - **Visual Intent**: Over-shoulder shot of petting, fur compressing and releasing.
  - **Audio Intent**: Full purr bed rising above ambient noise.

## Visual Development Notes

- Lighting contrast should feel ritualistic yet domestic: single 3200K lamp versus deep blue ambient shadows.
- Highlight subtle bioluminescent quality in palms and sigil; keep glow warm gold to echo lamp tone.
- 米漿 fur reference: plush grey-blue with sheen catching highlights around ears and tail.
- Include cardboard boxes, cat scratcher silhouettes, and wooden flooring texture for grounded realism.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Prioritize Real Cinema lens set: 35mm for establishing, 50mm for human-cat interactions, 75mm for hands and paws.
- Camera mostly tripod/slider steady; introduce minimal 3% handheld breath during snap to convey energy.
- Maintain shutter 180° and shallow depth (T2.0–T2.8) to isolate glow details against dark background.
- Transitions rely on direct cuts with occasional light-match on glowing lines.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- Music: low-key lo-fi pads with slight bell tones timed to glowing lines.
- Foley: HVAC rumble, fabric rustle, finger snap, cardboard creak, paw taps, sniff, purr.
- Vocal: whispered nicknames recorded close-mic with soft reverb tail; avoid additional dialogue.
- Mix target: -14 LUFS, keep high-frequency air to prevent overly dry room tone.
