## One-Sentence Concept

A sleepy grey-blue cat named 米漿 awakens in a dim apartment and launches into a playful 15-second chase after a laser pointer, eventually settling into a warm cuddle with its human.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Quiet Spark
- **Beat**: Lamp-Lit Stillness — Establish the dark room with the lone warm lamp and 米漿 curled on the carpet.
  - **Visual Intent**: Locked mid shot with soft falloff, emphasizing the amber light pool against surrounding shadow.
  - **Audio Intent**: Low HVAC hum and distant traffic, breathing barely audible.
- **Beat**: Drowsy Close-Up — Push in to 米漿’s half-closed eyes and whiskers catching the glow.
  - **Visual Intent**: Gentle slider-in to a tight close-up, showcasing fur texture and eyelid flicker.
  - **Audio Intent**: Whisper-quiet room tone, subtle purr undercurrent.
- **Beat**: Ear Twitch Cue — Capture the tiny ear flick and eye dilation triggered by the laser switch click.
  - **Visual Intent**: Hold close-up while animating only ear and pupil response; keep background blurred.
  - **Audio Intent**: Include a precise “click” of the laser pen, highlighting the moment of alertness.
- **Beat**: First Red Dot — Follow the laser dot skimming wall to carpet, reflecting in 米漿’s eyes.
  - **Visual Intent**: Dutch-ish over-the-shoulder showing dot travel and sparkle in cat’s gaze.
  - **Audio Intent**: Fabric rustle as the cat prepares to move.

### Act II – Chase Routine
- **Beat**: Wiggle Launch Prep — Show 米漿 crouched with wiggling hips and tail flagging before the pounce.
  - **Visual Intent**: Low rear angle focusing on hindquarters tension and tail rhythm.
  - **Audio Intent**: Claw tips brushing carpet fibers with soft scrapes.
- **Beat**: First Pounce — Track 米漿 exploding forward, paws slapping carpet in blur.
  - **Visual Intent**: Handheld-style rush alongside cat for kinetic energy, motion blur accentuating speed.
  - **Audio Intent**: Sharp paw thump and collar bell jingle.
- **Beat**: Sofa Side Sprint — Side-follow as the cat chases the dot along the sofa base, rucking fabric folds.
  - **Visual Intent**: Medium profile tracking shot showing paws compressing cushions.
  - **Audio Intent**: Sofa fabric brushing rhythmically with rapid footfalls.
- **Beat**: Wall Bound — Laser jumps high; 米漿 springs up, taps wall, lands shaking out fur.
  - **Visual Intent**: Tilt-up capturing vertical leap and landing ripple through fur.
  - **Audio Intent**: Soft wall thump and muted landing thud.

### Act III – Reunion Glow
- **Beat**: Lost the Dot — Laser vanishes; cat scans left-right with puzzled ears.
  - **Visual Intent**: Semi-close on head swivel, bokeh background.
  - **Audio Intent**: Off-camera human chuckle with slight breathiness.
- **Beat**: Dot Climbs Human — Reveal human torso with dot climbing to chest as hand retracts.
  - **Visual Intent**: Chest-level framing on seated human, red spot traveling upward.
  - **Audio Intent**: Clothing rustle and human whisper “這裡。”
- **Beat**: Cat Checks In — 米漿 trots to feet, looks up pant leg toward dot, whiskers vibrating.
  - **Visual Intent**: Low angle from behind human capturing cat gaze upward.
  - **Audio Intent**: Quick patter footsteps, purr swelling in.
- **Beat**: Warm Fade-Out — Pull wide to show human petting 米漿, both basking in lamp glow with caption.
  - **Visual Intent**: Slow dolly out to wide with elongated shadows; subtitle fades in.
  - **Audio Intent**: Purring dominant as ambient noise falls away.

## Visual Development Notes

- Apartment palette: deep teal shadows balanced with one 3200K lamp pool; keep contrast soft yet sculpted.
- 米漿 fur reference: Russian Blue-inspired grey-blue with velvet sheen catching highlights; emphasize whisker detail.
- Maintain natural grain and gentle vignette to preserve cozy nocturnal tone.
- Ensure human wardrobe is neutral knit textures to reflect warm domesticity, no logos.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Use `Real Cinema Lens Set` focal lengths: 35mm establishing, 50mm for emotional mid-shots, 75mm inserts on whiskers and laser dot reflections.
- Motion approach: tripod/slider stability for calm beats; limited 3% handheld mimic during pounce for energetic feel.
- Keep shutter angle at 180° for natural motion blur; maintain shallow depth (T2.0–T2.8) during intimacy shots.
- Transitions rely on direct cuts and occasional light-match on the red dot sweep.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- Music bed: gentle lo-fi piano pads with subtle percussive ticks that sync with cat movements.
- Foley layers: HVAC/traffic bed, carpet scratches, paw thumps, collar bell, soft wall tap, clothing rustle.
- Dialogue/Vocal: Only whispered cue “這裡” plus restrained chuckle; elevate purr to foreground for resolution.
- Mix target: -14 LUFS overall, preserve room air while controlling low-frequency rumble.
