# Rhythm City — "Remixing the Pulse" PV2 Script

## Logline
Lu Jie hijacks MetroScore's perfect pulse inside an abandoned platform, layering kicks, snares, and glitch percussion until the entire city breathes in his remixed rhythm.

## Structure Overview（15 秒｜12 幕）
- **Format**：2D 霓虹動畫＋HUD 視覺化節奏圖層
- **Tempo Arc**：120 BPM 系統拍 → Kick 半拍錯位 → 108 BPM 路節自定 Groove
- **Sound Layers**：Metronome（L）、Kick（R）、Snare＆Hi-hat（Center）、環境節拍 Sample、短合成器和弦

## Beat Breakdown
1. **System Default Pulse（0–1s）** — Night aerial of a cross intersection where traffic lights, cars, and pedestrians move in flawless 4/4 sync; cold metronome dominates.
2. **Singular Heartline（1–2s）** — Control room wall of waveforms; only the master track remains active, labeled "MetroScore NORMAL" with a soft system ping.
3. **Second Low Frequency（2–3s）** — Rusted platform floor, rippling puddle as an off-grid kick shakes the frame.
4. **Lu Jie Preps the Beat（3–4s）** — Side mid-shot as Lu Jie dons headphones and lays a palm on his pocket pad; wrist HUD unfurls tracks.
5. **Snare Against the Grid（4–5s）** — Finger close-up tapping two pads, gritty snare firing on offbeats.
6. **Hi-hat Sparks（5–6s）** — Half-body front shot; he flicks a virtual square into life with shimmering hi-hats.
7. **Lights Follow His Groove（6–7s）** — Pullback showing platform lights, neons, and LEDs blinking in Lu Jie's rhythm while official pulse fades.
8. **Breath Remix（7–8s）** — Close on an office worker's panicked breathing slowing to match the kick, shoulders easing.
9. **Control Room Distortion（8–9s）** — Master monitor shows a rogue white waveform climbing, alarms flashing.
10. **City as Drum Kit（9–10s）** — Rapid montage: rolling gate slam, train wind rush, distant brake squeal captured as samples.
11. **Live Remix Focus（10–12s）** — Beaded sweat on Lu Jie's face, eyes reflecting waveform rings as soft synth chords bloom.
12. **Glitch Beat Freeze（12–15s）** — LED soles flash with the last four hits, freeze-frame on Lu Jie staring up as HUD prints "GLITCH BEAT / LIVE EDIT" and logo resolves.

## Dialogue & VO Notes
- No spoken dialogue; focus on rhythmic breathing, system prompts, and musical layering.
- Control room alert voice whispers "Anomaly" on Beat 9, processed as percussion.

## Visual Motifs
- Amber vs. cyan duotone indicating MetroScore vs. Re-Beat control.
- HUD waveform strips orbiting Lu Jie's wrists and temples when he adds layers.
- Puddles, neon panels, and LED soles acting as diegetic metronomes.

## Audio Motifs
- Cold metronome click (solo L channel) bleeding into warm low-end kick (R).
- Snare with granular grit hitting offbeat 8th notes, hi-hat sprinkling 16th-note syncopation.
- Environmental samples pitch-shifted to form fills and risers, ending with a glitchy reverb cut.
