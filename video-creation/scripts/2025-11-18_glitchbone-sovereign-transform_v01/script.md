# Glitchbone Sovereign Transform PV Script Draft

## Logline
Deep within the grid-cut Errormesh Basin, the Glitchbone Sovereign rewinds corpses into a colossal triple-skulled beast, unleashes a formatting field, and locks eyes with Yecheng as debugger warnings flood his HUD.

## Beat Notes
1. Establish the Errormesh Basin beyond the border: regimented trenches glow with circuit seams beneath a thunderous purple storm ceiling.
2. Mountain of bone-beast carcasses rewinds, limbs sliding back toward the basin center as mud streaks drag in reverse.
3. Close-up on an outward bone plate as duplicated circuit decals flicker and detach toward the forming body.
4. Wide silhouette of the colossal quadruped partially rendered, half solid bone armor, half wireframe nodes suspended in the air.
5. Triple-layered skull assembles: outer beast head seals, humanoid skull rotates inside, polygonal core pulses within.
6. Neon rectangular eyes refresh erratically across fractures, error-window pupils blinking like UI pop-ups.
7. Basin environment glitches: trees voxelize, rocks split into grid slices, nearby beasts briefly convert into wireframes.
8. Semi-rendered minions tear off the Sovereign's spine ridge and drop, finishing their compile mid-fall before charging outward.
9. Multi-jointed forelimb lifts and slams, lighting an enormous Format Field circuit array with HUD warnings.
10. Cut to Yecheng atop the distant border palisade; his HUD floods with Error Logs as he witnesses the awakening.
11. Curve Bolt interface warps when aimed at the Sovereign, trajectory previews forced toward a prewritten lock point.
12. Extreme close on the Sovereign's primary neon pupil reflecting Yecheng; DEBUGGER DETECTED flashes before the screen hard-cuts to black.
