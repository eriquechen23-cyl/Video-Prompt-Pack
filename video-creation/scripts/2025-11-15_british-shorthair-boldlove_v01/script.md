## One-Sentence Concept

An aloof-looking British Shorthair named 米漿 bulldozes into their human's desk setup mid-work, weaponizing purrs and belly-flops until the laptop — and the human — belong entirely to cuddle time.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Intrusion Prelude
- **Beat**: Keyboard Rain — Establish the human typing furiously in a cold-lit study while the sound of keys dominates.
  - **Visual Intent**: Overhead desk view showcasing blue monitor glow on hands and tabletop.
  - **Audio Intent**: Rhythmic typing layered with HVAC hush.
- **Beat**: Shadow Approaches — Grey-blue ears and tail edge into frame as the cat readies a leap.
  - **Visual Intent**: Maintain same overhead with slight push-in to heighten anticipation.
  - **Audio Intent**: Continue typing with a faint questioning meow.
- **Beat**: Impact Landing — Cat jumps onto desk and pauses before the keyboard like choosing a seat.
  - **Visual Intent**: Side handheld follow catching the soft thud and fur ripple.
  - **Audio Intent**: Damped thump plus tabletop resonance.
- **Beat**: Full-Screen Butt — Cat sits squarely on the keyboard, engulfing the frame in plush fur.
  - **Visual Intent**: Low frontal angle from keyboard toward monitor with cat rear dominating view.
  - **Audio Intent**: Sustained keyboard error tone.

### Act II – Chaos & Charm Offensive
- **Beat**: Monitor Meltdown — Cut to monitor spitting out garbled characters and scrolling wildly.
  - **Visual Intent**: Tight crop on screen edges glowing blue, rim-lit by fur halo.
  - **Audio Intent**: UI error chime over silence as typing stops.
- **Beat**: Cold Stare — Cat slowly looks back with wide pupils, tail flicking.
  - **Visual Intent**: Side medium capturing human in background defeated.
  - **Audio Intent**: Soft exhale, room quiet.
- **Beat**: Headbutt Warning — Human hand tries to nudge; cat counters with a forceful cheek rub.
  - **Visual Intent**: Close on hand and cat brow colliding, whiskers bent forward.
  - **Audio Intent**: Fur brushing skin with the first rumble of a purr.
- **Beat**: Engine Ignition — Extreme close-up of vibrating throat as purr crescendos.
  - **Visual Intent**: Macro detail of chin fluff shimmering in blue light.
  - **Audio Intent**: Purr dominates, low frequency hum.

### Act III – Total Surrender
- **Beat**: Dive into Arms — Cat rolls bodily into human’s arms, paws curling.
  - **Visual Intent**: Three-quarter overhead showing tumble into embrace.
  - **Audio Intent**: Fabric rustle, small resigned chuckle.
- **Beat**: Belly Parade — Cat flips belly-up, limbs slack, inviting scritches.
  - **Visual Intent**: Belly close-up framed like a cloud of fur with human hand hovering.
  - **Audio Intent**: Random key presses as paws shift.
- **Beat**: Work vs. Cat — Wider half-body view of human giving in and rubbing belly while subtitle appears.
  - **Visual Intent**: Show desk chaos, screen corner, and human stroking fur.
  - **Audio Intent**: Purr volume increases like a space heater.
- **Beat**: Persona Collapse — Hold on wide desk tableau: frozen keyboard, sleeping cat draped on arm, tagline on-screen.
  - **Visual Intent**: Static tableau capturing surrendered human and cat.
  - **Audio Intent**: Purrs and HVAC only.

## Visual Development Notes

- Lighting: Contrast the cold cyan spill of the monitor with warmer accent bounce from desk lamp off-camera to keep fur detail readable.
- Fur reference: British Shorthair blue with dense plush texture; emphasize rounded cheeks and thick tail.
- Desk props: Black mechanical keyboard, matte monitor, scattered sticky notes flipped blank-side-up to avoid text.
- Background: Minimalistic study with cool grey walls and subtle paper stacks, keeping focus on cat-human interaction.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Adopt Real Cinema lens trio (35/50/75mm) for intimacy: 35mm overhead establishing, 50mm medium interactions, 75mm macro fur/hand shots.
- Movements primarily tripod or slider glides; allow slight handheld sway (<3%) during leap and cuddle beats for organic feel.
- Maintain shutter 180° and shallow depth (T2.0–T2.8) to isolate cat textures against softer background.
- Transitions rely on direct cuts with occasional monitor-light whip pan for energy between chaos beats.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- Music optional: lean on diegetic typing, error tone, and purr engine as primary audio narrative.
- Foley checklist: keyboard clacks, desk thump, fabric shift, fur rub, purr layers, subtle meow, HVAC bed.
- Maintain dynamic range per core audio pack (-18 ~ -6 dBFS) with limiter at -1 dBTP; ensure purr sits around -8 dBFS peak without distortion.

## Safety & Compliance Checklist

- Follow `Real Cinema Safety Checklist`: remove or blur logos and readable text on desk objects; keep lighting comfortable for animal.
- Monitor error graphics must remain abstract blocks, avoiding real company interfaces.
- Document LUT, grain, and random seed selections for QA reproducibility.
