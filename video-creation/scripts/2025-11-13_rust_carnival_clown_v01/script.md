## One-Sentence Concept

An unstable clown-saboteur prowls a rain-soaked, rusted-out amusement park and unleashes two battlefield crowd-control skills in a 15-second AAA realism trailer.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Setup
- **Beat**: Rust-Stained Overture — Establish the abandoned amusement park drenched in rain and iron scent.
- **Visual Intent**: Low, gliding dolly tracking through puddled midway toward a broken Ferris wheel; 35mm focal for environmental immersion; emphasize corroded steel and dripping neon reflections.
- **Audio Intent**: Surround rain-on-metal foley with distant creaking; low sub-bass drone that hints at tension.

- **Beat**: Jester Emerges — The clown enters frame dragging oversized shoes across shattered glass.
- **Visual Intent**: Close 50mm shot on weathered makeup streaking under rain; sparks of refracted light from shards.
- **Audio Intent**: Foley of wet rubber scraping glass, subtle breathy chuckle pushed to rear channels.

### Act II – Confrontation
- **Beat**: Weaponized Balloons — Reveal balloons as deadly steel-wire garrote shimmering in the rain.
- **Visual Intent**: Tight insert, 75mm focus rack from balloon surface to taut wires; micro droplets catching highlights.
- **Audio Intent**: Twanging metallic tension with metallic shimmer SFX, muted heartbeats.

- **Beat**: Skill Prep – Paper Finale — Clown fans a deck of cards ready for 《紙牌終焉雨》.
- **Visual Intent**: Slow-motion finger flourish; cards catching cold moonlight; lens flare from distant flood.
- **Audio Intent**: Rising percussive ticks synced with finger snaps, high-frequency hiss building pressure.

- **Beat**: Paper Rain Detonates — Cards explode outward, slicing enemies and detonating shockwave.
- **Visual Intent**: 35mm wide AOE impact; volumetric dust and card trails; enemies lifted in debris halo.
- **Audio Intent**: Whip-crack card SFX leading into glass-like shatter and concussive bass hit.

- **Beat**: Aftershock Pose — Clown balances on one leg at blast edge, teasing next attack.
- **Visual Intent**: Heroic low-angle; raindrops streak across lens; single card flicked toward camera.
- **Audio Intent**: Echoing giggle, metallic ping as card flicks, rain ambience sustained.

- **Beat**: Chalk Ritual — Draws the 《歡笑劇場圈》 glowing circle on cracked asphalt.
- **Visual Intent**: Overhead tracking shot following chalk line igniting multicolor ground lights through mist.
- **Audio Intent**: Chalk scrape foley blended with filtered calliope motif; subtle laugh track swell.

- **Beat**: Laughter Trap — Enemies slow and stumble as spectral applause erupts inside circle.
- **Visual Intent**: Medium shot inside arena; motion blur pulses to show temporal drag; forced slapstick slips.
- **Audio Intent**: Detuned applause loop, glitching laughter, muffled weapon clatter.

### Act III – Resolution
- **Beat**: Puppetmaster Silhouette — Clown conducts from shadow outside circle.
- **Visual Intent**: Silhouette profile, rain rim light, dramatic hand gestures controlling chaos.
- **Audio Intent**: Deepened crowd laugh panned wide, rhythmic claps controlling tempo.

- **Beat**: Battlefield Silence — Enemies collapse, sound drops to deadened hush.
- **Visual Intent**: Slow dolly through steam-filled arena, bodies sprawled among playing cards and balloons.
- **Audio Intent**: Low-pass filtered rain with vacuumed hush; distant Ferris wheel creak.

- **Beat**: Exit Echo — Clown walks away through puddles, leaving stillness.
- **Visual Intent**: Tracking shot on trailing shoe splashes; balloons sway against stormy skyline.
- **Audio Intent**: Lone footstep sloshes, faint laugh fading into wind.

## Character & Scene Roster

- **Ironclad Clown** — War-scarred jester, runny white face paint, rust-stained tactical suit integrating carnival motifs, wields card deck and balloon-wire rig.
- **Shadow Militia** — Masked raiders in piecemeal armor, silhouettes kept soft focus to avoid identifiable markings.
- **Key Locations**:
  - Abandoned Midway — Flooded asphalt, broken stalls, corroded signage.
  - Ferris Wheel Plaza — Half-toppled wheel grinding in the wind, central AOE battleground.
  - Chalk Theatre Ring — Neon-lit circle carved into asphalt, filled with vapor and holographic laughter FX.
- **Signature Props**: Steel-wire balloons, custom deck of razor-edged cards, rain-slick chalk, shrapnel-studded boots.

## Visual Language & Style Notes

- Anchor to `Real Cinema Look` LUT with warm highlights and cool shadows to emphasize wet metal sheen.
- Maintain natural grain, soft contrast, and 60 IRE skin exposure on the clown despite rain streaks.
- Lean into volumetric rain mist and practical sparks; keep blood implied via armor scoring instead of gore.
- Palette: oxidized oranges, electric cyan light strips, desaturated environment with controlled warm accents.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Use `Real Cinema Lens Set` focal lengths: 35mm wides for spatial awareness, 50mm for character emotion, 75mm inserts on props.
- Primary motion: slider or dolly glide-ins at 0.8 speed ratio; occasional 180° shutter ensures natural motion blur.
- Integrate one slow-motion beat during card fan flourish (48fps playback to 24fps) and re-accelerate for impact.
- Maintain 3% handheld allowance only during shockwave to convey chaos, otherwise stabilized.
- Transition strategy: match cuts on clown laughter and card flicks to maintain rhythm over 12 beats.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- Music: hybrid orchestral-industrial bed with muted calliope motifs; escalate intensity during each skill activation.
- Foley: emphasize rain, creaking metal, chalk scratch, and card slicing; layer metallic resonance under balloon wires.
- Voiceover: none; rely on clown’s laughter cues (captured dry and processed with slapback delay).
- Mix: prioritize dynamic range, punchy LFE on explosions, maintain clear midrange for atmospheric SFX.
