- **Metadata File (optional)**: _N/A（單支 PV）_

## One-Sentence Concept
A 15-second teaser where Nassal, Lord of Drowned Light, summons an upside-down ocean cathedral and weaponizes drowned memories to challenge the player during the apocalyptic flood cycle known as the Drowned Light Faultline.

## Act & Beat Outline
### Act I – Setup（0.0–4.8s）
- **Beat 1：環形海洋鳥瞰** – Satellite push-in over concentric ring oceans looming above the city; highlight ritual glow seams that foreshadow the reverse tide. _Tie to Master Prompt scene beat 01_
- **Beat 2：海壁裂縫與預兆** – Tracking along the cracking sea wall as water begins to crawl upward; sparks of refraction hint at Nassal’s presence. _Master Scene Beat 02_
- **Beat 3：水下倒影城市→淺水殿堂** – Transition underwater to reveal an inverted reflection of the city, then slam cut to the flooded cathedral floor as the protagonist steps in. _Master Scene Beat 03–04_

### Act II – Confrontation（4.8–9.6s）
- **Beat 4：倒影先行／BOSS 現身** – The water’s surface manifests Nassal’s silhouette before his physical form rises; halo rings activate. _Scene Beat 05–07_
- **Beat 5：水刃與記憶攻勢** – Show water-blade lash, mirror barrages projecting failed runs, and Nassal’s verdict lines synced to VO. _Scene Beat 08–09_
- **Beat 6：倒灌轉場** – Cataclysmic shot of ceiling rupture and inverted deluge; environment flips orientation. _Scene Beat 10_

### Act III – Resolution（9.6–15.0s）
- **Beat 7：倒置雙世界** – Split image of upright arena and reflected upside-down phase, hinting at pattern-reading gameplay. _Scene Beat 11_
- **Beat 8：Title Card & Threat** – Nassal reaches toward camera as title resolves, delivering final threat line. _Scene Beat 12_

## Character & Scene Roster
- **溺光君・那薩爾（Nassal）** – Male-coded tidal warden, face made of rippling water/mirror shards, halo of triple rotating rings, ceremonial coat dissolving into water ribbons, chest triangle reservoir of drowned memories, water-blade gloves.
- **玩家剪影** – Anonymous adventurer silhouette whose reflections and past deaths appear in water mirrors; rarely seen directly except as POV hands/feet.
- **環形海洋＆階潮城** – Layered ocean walls circling the metropolis; key props include cracked sea-wall sigils, inverted skyline reflections, flooded cathedral interior, collapsing lightwell.

## Visual Language & Style Notes
- Dark fantasy cinematic realism emphasizing volumetric aqua light, god rays through mist, and reflective caustics across wet stone.
- Color palette: cold blue-green primaries with pale gold highlights; maintain specular streaks on wet surfaces and prismatic halos.
- Texture focus: water skin refraction, broken mirror shards, suspended droplets; clothing uses deep blue/moss green woven with gold embroidery.
- Halo VFX must rotate on three axes with opposite spin directions, splitting light into RGB dispersion.

## Camera & Motion Plan
- Lens set anchored at 24–85mm; aerial intro 24mm, cathedral beats 35–50mm, hero shots 65–85mm compression for menace.
- Motion grammar: glidecams and crane pushes; no handheld beyond 3% micro jitter. Underwater beat uses slow dolly-in with parallax caustics.
- Key transitions: match cut from aerial whirlpool to inverted reflection; whip-pan using water blade; rotational cut for world flip.

## Audio & Voice Strategy
- Base bed: distant thunder rumbles + slow tide drones + bowed metal tension from Storm Boss pack.
- VO plan: mix of narrator (low male) and Nassal (androgynous, watery resonance). Lines pulled from provided script (Tagline + Beat lines).
- SFX palette: reverse-flow water, refraction chimes, memory echo whispers, hydraulic booms for flood inversion, crystalline snap for title.
- Music pacing: 70 BPM pulse with sub-hits aligned to beat transitions.

## Pace & Timing Grid
- 00:00–01:20 圈海鳥瞰
- 01:20–02:40 海壁裂縫
- 02:40–04:00 水下倒影城市
- 04:00–05:20 殿堂腳步
- 05:20–06:40 倒影＋現身
- 06:40–08:00 光環啟動＋水刃
- 08:00–09:20 記憶攻擊
- 09:20–10:80 倒灌翻轉
- 10:80–12:40 上下顛倒雙世界
- 12:40–15:00 Title Card + Threat

## Safety & Compliance Checklist
- Maintain no real-world logos, brands, or readable text.
- Keep gore absent; violence remains abstract via water/light.
- Confirm flicker rate of god rays under 8Hz to avoid photo-sensitivity triggers.
