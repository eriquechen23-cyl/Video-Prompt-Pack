## One-Sentence Concept

In a rain-lashed derelict amusement plaza, the Rust Carnival King unveils his entrance flourish, commandeers Phase 2's steel marionette theatre, and erupts into a mechanical fury for Phase 3 in a 15-second AAA realism boss showcase.

## Act & Beat Outline

### Act I – Entrance Overture (Phase 1 Primer)
- **Beat**: Rain-Slick Plaza Reveal — Establish the circular boss arena with drenched stone tiles and creaking rides.
  - **Visual Intent**: 35mm dolly glide hugging reflective puddles toward the central carousel where sparks flicker from broken bulbs.
  - **Audio Intent**: Layered rainfall, distant chain clinks, low thunder rumbles.
- **Beat**: Rust Carnival King Descends — Rusted steel cables lower the boss atop the carousel dais.
  - **Visual Intent**: 50mm medium shot from below; red-black coat dripping, cables taut behind.
  - **Audio Intent**: Metallic screeches, cable tension groans, echoing footsteps on wet wood.
- **Beat**: Masked Gaze — Close insert on fractured porcelain clown mask and glowing mechanical eye.
  - **Visual Intent**: 75mm rack focus from rain-dappled mask crack to amber iris.
  - **Audio Intent**: Subtle clockwork whir, filtered chuckle, rain tapping ceramic.
- **Beat**: Paper Arsenal Flare — Boss flicks serrated cards into a hovering arc as warm sparks ignite Phase 1 threat.
  - **Visual Intent**: 50mm slow motion card fan catching neon reflections.
  - **Audio Intent**: Sharp card flicks synced to stuttering percussion ticks.

### Act II – Steel Marionette Theatre (Phase 2 Transformation)
- **Beat**: Arena Awakening — Boss slams twisted cane; broken rides jerk upright under rusted cables.
  - **Visual Intent**: 35mm wide orbit revealing kinetic environment pieces pulled by glowing cables.
  - **Audio Intent**: Resonant staff strike, cable snaps, chorus of groaning metal.
  - **Angle 1 — Cable Ignition Push**: Start on a tight 50mm shot of the cane striking wet stone, sparks splashing across puddles before snapping into a 35mm jib rise that reveals cables shooting out toward the carousel. Motion eases to accentuate the moment cables latch onto ride skeletons.
  - **Angle 2 — Ride Reanimation Orbit**: Transition via match-cut on cable tension into a 24mm clockwise orbit around the carousel as each attached ride jolts upright, creating overlapping parallax layers of swaying horses and flickering bulbs.
- **Beat**: Puppet Line Sweep — Steel tether lashes yank carousel horses into charging lanes.
  - **Visual Intent**: 24mm sweeping shot along red warning lines streaking across wet stone.
  - **Audio Intent**: Doppler horse whirs, rattling bells, rain-slashed whooshes.
  - **Angle 1 — Warning Line Glide**: Glide-cam skim 10cm above the slick tiles following a newly drawn crimson tether line; particles spray outward as the horse statue tears free in the background, adding forward momentum.
  - **Angle 2 — Horse Charge Whip-Pan**: Snap into a 35mm whip-pan that tracks a carousel horse barreling across frame, bells clanging while the steel cable pulses with orange energy.
  - **Angle 3 — Player POV Dodge**: Switch to a 50mm handheld tilt from the presumed player perspective ducking beneath the lashing cable, emphasizing motion blur and raindrop streaks.
- **Beat**: Rusted Deluge — Cards detonate overhead into iron-flecked rainfall with safe shadow pocket signaled.
  - **Visual Intent**: Overhead view; luminous safe zone glows under carousel canopy while sparks cascade.
  - **Audio Intent**: Metallic hiss, dense pinging debris, heart-throb bass swell when impacts land.
  - **Angle 1 — Zenith Safety Map**: Drone-style 18mm top shot showing full arena; animate the safe shadow area pulsing cyan while orange card shrapnel trails arc inward.
  - **Angle 2 — Shadow Refuge Insert**: Drop to a 75mm mid shot under the carousel canopy where rain slackens; focus racks from a dangling rag doll to sparks exploding just beyond the safe zone edge.
  - **Angle 3 — Impact Rain Slice**: Cut to a 35mm lateral tracking shot slicing through the metallic rain curtain, using slow shutter drag to emphasize streaks and ricochets.
- **Beat**: Curtain Collapse — Concentric red rings contract toward boss forcing players inward.
  - **Visual Intent**: 50mm top-down shrinking rings, floor glyphs pulsing to beat.
  - **Audio Intent**: Pulsed choir hits marking ring steps, breathy laughter cadence.
  - **Angle 1 — Glyph Pulse Topper**: Begin with a 50mm overhead locked shot as concentric rings ignite sequentially, synchronized to choir stabs.
  - **Angle 2 — Inward Rush Dolly**: Snap to a 35mm dolly-in aligned with the contracting rings, using motion blur on the floor patterns to stress urgency while the boss stands poised center frame.
  - **Angle 3 — Counter-Strike Setup**: Finish on a 75mm over-the-shoulder of the player avatar closing distance, letting steam and rain backlight the boss to set up the retaliation window.

### Act III – Core Ignition (Phase 3 Frenzy)
- **Beat**: Mask Shatters — Boss tears off porcelain mask; rain steams against exposed cybernetic jaw.
  - **Visual Intent**: 75mm close-up; shards fall in slow motion, core glow intensifies.
  - **Audio Intent**: Ceramic crack, servo wind-up, rain sizzling on heated metal.
- **Beat**: Rhythm Stride — Boss lunges with cane-lance combo, rhythm lights chasing each step.
  - **Visual Intent**: 35mm tracking shot; floor beat-markers ignite under feet toward camera.
  - **Audio Intent**: Syncopated bass hits, cane slashes accented by whip cracks.
- **Beat**: Final Card Barrage — Five crimson cards lock onto player, leaving flaming rings.
  - **Visual Intent**: 50mm mid shot; cards streak as red trails forming concentric fire halos.
  - **Audio Intent**: Rising glissando, consecutive explosions, embers fizzing in rain.
- **Beat**: Core Overload Window — Boss impales cane, exposing chest core for counter window.
  - **Visual Intent**: 75mm push-in on glowing core as rain vaporizes into steam cloud.
  - **Audio Intent**: Deep mechanical hum, suction effect for AoE DOT, sudden drop to silence inviting counter-strike.

## Character & Scene Roster

- **Rust Carnival King** — Tall, gaunt warlord in rain-glossed red-black military coat; porcelain clown mask with crack exposing amber cybernetic eye; carries serrated metal cards and a morphing cane-lance; four rusted cable puppets trailing bells and rag dolls.
- **Shadow Militia** — Faceless armored silhouettes thrown into scene as scale references, blurred during impacts to avoid identifiers.
- **Key Locations**:
  - Carousel Plaza — Circular boss arena with puddled stone tiles and skeletal carousel centerpiece.
  - Ruined Ferris Wheel Rim — Tilting wheel provides background scale and moving shadows.
  - Rain-Sheared Midway — Broken stalls and hanging light strings that occasionally spark.
- **Signature Props**: Serrated metal cards, twisted cane transforming between chain and spear, rusted marionette cables with dangling bells.

## Visual Language & Style Notes

- Anchor visuals in Real Cinema Look: warm highlights from sporadic sparks against cool rain shadows.
- Emphasize wet specular surfaces on coat fabric, cables, and puddles; keep volumetric rain and mist thick for depth.
- Maintain controlled bursts of orange fire vs cyan rain reflections to track phase escalation.
- Use verticality of carousel and Ferris wheel to frame boss silhouette and stage transitions.

## Camera & Motion Plan

- Primary focal lengths: 24mm for arena sweeps, 35mm for kinetic tracking, 50–75mm for character inserts per Real Cinema Lens Set.
- Motion: slider/dolly glides with occasional 0.03 handheld allowance during explosions; orbit shots emphasize circular arena.
- Shutter locked near 180° except for explosive beats where 200° accentuates spray trails.
- Transition anchors: match-on-action via card flicks, cable whips, and core pulses to maintain rhythm through 12 beats.

## Audio & Voice Strategy

- Music bed: industrial orchestral hybrid with ticking clock motifs escalating into percussion-heavy rhythm for Phase 3.
- Foley priority: rain on metal, tensioned cables, card shuriken slices, mechanical servos, bell chimes.
- Vocal elements: filtered carnival laughter snippets, reverb-drenched taunts during transformations.
- Mix: maintain -14 LUFS overall; allow dynamic peaks on explosions while preserving ambient rain texture.

## Safety & Compliance Checklist

- Follow Real Cinema Safety Checklist: obscure any legible signage, keep crowd silhouettes defocused.
- Maintain natural skin (or porcelain) texture with 55–65 IRE exposure on visible flesh/ceramic surfaces.
- Document LUT, random seeds, and any particle caches for QA reproducibility.
- Avoid explicit gore; represent damage via sparks, armor scoring, and water displacement.
