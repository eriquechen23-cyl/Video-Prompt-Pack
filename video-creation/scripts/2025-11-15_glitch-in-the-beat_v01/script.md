# Rhythm City — "Glitch in the Beat" PV Script

## Logline
Lu Jie, the underground DJ who can rewrite MetroScore's rigid pulse, hijacks a fifteen-second slice of Rhythm City to reveal the hidden beat.

## Beat Breakdown
1. **MetroScore Pulse** — Night aerial of Rhythm City syncing in perfect 120 BPM; HUD tag: "MetroScore ONLINE".
2. **Step Sync** — Tracking Lu Jie's LED sneakers hitting the zebra crossing exactly on the beat.
3. **BPM Spike** — Side close-up as he dons headphones; readout jumps to "???" while he winces.
4. **Glitch Overlay** — POV HUD of street lanes turning into music tracks; one waveform desyncs with a "GLITCH" tag.
5. **Abandoned Platform** — Descend into a dim, flickering metro platform plastered with half-torn "FREE BEAT" posters.
6. **Gear Lock-In** — Montage of finger drumming the pocket pad, wrist HUD blooming, headphones sealing in place.
7. **Re-Beat Surge** — Half-body shot; he exhales and pushes forward, slicing the air into measure grids as lights resync to his tempo.
8. **Split City** — Smash cut topside where billboards now pulse with Lu's beat while pedestrians stay on MetroScore timing.
9. **Relief Breath** — Offbeat office worker on the platform unwinds, syncing breaths with Lu's custom rhythm.
10. **Regulator Alert** — Control room monitors show clean waves disrupted by one chaotic white current; alarm flashes "ANOMALY DETECTED".
11. **Rebel Line** — Dramatic side close-up of Lu with waveform irises, smirking at the unseen regulators.
12. **Title Hit** — City compresses into waveform graphics that resolve into the logo: "Rhythm City — Glitch in the Beat".

## Dialogue & VO Notes
- JP VO: 「同じリズムだけじゃ、生きていけないだろ。」／中文字幕：『只用一種節奏活著，太無聊了吧。』
- SFX: System warning ping layered with hi-hat glitch when "ANOMALY DETECTED" appears.

## Visual Motifs
- Beat Spire halo pulsing like a metronome crown in wide shots.
- White waveform overlays tracing Lu Jie's eyes and wrist HUD when he rewrites tempo.
- Neon cyan vs. MetroScore amber light duotone to contrast official vs. free beats.

## Audio Motifs
- Base groove at 120 BPM, accelerating to 132 BPM during the glitch before stabilizing to Lu's 108 BPM pocket.
- Layered hi-hat glitch marking hidden beat cues, sidechain-pumping bass with subway rumble.
- Crowd chatter filtered as rhythmic chops, contrasted with airy breaths when relief scene hits.
