# 黑龍守門人 PV Script Draft

## Logline
A black dragon free-falls at noon, shattering into an East Asian muscle-bound youth draped in living scales; when he locks eyes with the world, no one knows whether he guards the gate or heralds catastrophe.

## Beat Notes
1. Noon sky dims as an enormous shadow expands; a dragon silhouette rips through the clouds and dives.
2. Side follow shot of the black dragon; jet-dark scales rimmed by white sunlight, wings sweeping shock mist.
3. Impact on the ground sends soil and debris outward; roadside signs and grass shudder in the shockwave.
4. Close on the dragon’s head exhaling a black ring that eats daylight from center outward.
5. Overhead view as the dragon form fractures; scales spiral upward, revealing a glowing humanoid core.
6. Bare feet or black boots land amid rubble; a few scales clink down beside the ankles.
7. Back shot: scales climb the spine and settle into a cape and pauldrons over broad shoulders.
8. Side face close-up; short hair, defined eye bags, vertical slit pupil shrinking back to human.
9. Frontal mid-shot with crack-lined circle on the ground behind him, half blazing, half abyssal.
10. He steps forward; scaled cape lifts to reveal sculpted chest and collarbones, plates still twitching.
11. Orbit as his palm glows between salvation and destruction; distant city split between ruin and intact.
12. Final half-body close-up; one eye reflects blue sky, the other a black fissure, breathing steady before the question hangs: guardian or calamity?
