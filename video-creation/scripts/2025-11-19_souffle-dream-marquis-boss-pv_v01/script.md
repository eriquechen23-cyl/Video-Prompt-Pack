# Soufflé, Marquis of Dreams — Boss PV Script Draft

## Logline
At the floating garden atop the dream staircase, Soufflé, the androgynous Marquis of Dreams, lures intruders through cascading dream layers, edits their memories into weapons, and ends the encounter with a single ethereal snip that seals the world back into slumber.

## Beat Notes
1. Low-angle glide climbs an endless floating staircase toward a slim robed silhouette crowned by a broken spiral halo.
2. Hyper close-up on the heterochromia eyes; geometric UI symbols orbit the irises while a glass shard mask reflects strangers' dreams.
3. Orbiting medium shot reveals Soufflé unfurling miniature floating garden islands, trees and benches trailing like a reverse-gravity cape.
4. POV plunge: the staircase and night sky stretch like liquid as the viewer is yanked downward into another dream layer.
5. Childhood classroom, home corridor, and city street memories flicker as suspended panels, shattering apart midair.
6. Soufflé pinches and drags translucent dream tiles, snapping them into a new arena grid with editor-like UI beeps.
7. Somnolent Garden blooms beneath bare feet, pastel pollen spilling outward and slowing everything by a beat.
8. Player avatar charges but their attack animation is cleanly "cut" out of the timeline, freezing mid-swing.
9. The multi-ringed right-hand jewelry unfolds into a colossal transparent dream scissor traced with starfields.
10. Multiple platforms spawn memory-enemy apparitions around Soufflé, who conducts them like a maestro.
11. Exposure flips into white-gold; halo shards, butterflies, and floating stairs flare dangerously beautiful as power peaks.
12. Half-body close on Soufflé whispering "Don't rush to wake" before the dream scissors close, slicing the frame to black with the tagline.
