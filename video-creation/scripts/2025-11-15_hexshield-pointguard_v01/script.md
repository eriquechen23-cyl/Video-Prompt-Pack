4. Sequence of micro-shields forming a rapid mosaic to intercept multiple strikes.
5. Sweat evaporates instantly in the hot wind; palm trembles from constant magic flow.
6. Flash of intuition: envisioning a towering honeycomb wall rising.
7. Temptation of total defense collides with fear of instant mana drain and whiteout vision.
8. Mage exhales, deciding to conserve energy.
9. Returns to point-defense rhythm, conjuring shields only where needed.
10. Final interception repositions the mage for a counterstrike stance.
11. Sun glints through the lingering translucent shards.
12. Closing shot on determined eyes, ready to keep the line.
