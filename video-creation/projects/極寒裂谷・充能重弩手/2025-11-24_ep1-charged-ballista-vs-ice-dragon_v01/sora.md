  "global_prompt": "A perpetual-night ice gorge where motion is frozen midair; broken bridges and banners hang in place above fissures glowing lava red. Asakura Ren, a broad-shouldered heavy crossbowman, shoulders a charged ballista with glowing conduits that heat from deep red to white. Opposite him an ancient ice dragon exhales kinetic-freezing breath, its chest core pulsing blue-white. Camera rides a 120-degree arc from Ren's right rear, keeping cold moon key light from upper right and lava bounce from below while particle-rich snow drifts in slow gravity.",

      "prompt": "Overhead glide across the frozen gorge: shattered bridge spans, suspended rubble, and battle flags held mid-air above cracked ice lit by lava seams. Cold moon 5200K light casts soft-high contrast, with volumetric mist at 0.35 density and slow snowflakes 0.4 mm held by frozen kinetics. 24mm lens, layered depth from foreground shards to distant rotating clouds; no humans yet, only the eerie stillness. Ambient wind whispers at -12 dB with distant dragon rumbles."

      "prompt": "Low-angle lift as the ice dragon rises from the ravine, wings shaking loose crystal shards that streak toward camera. 28mm stabilized shot, focus on a glowing blue eye reflecting a tiny human silhouette; Fresnel reflections across scales, roughness 0.3, metallic 0.25. Side-back moonlight and blue scatter create high contrast, shards refract with IOR 1.31. Dragon roar peaks -6 dB, ice tinkles around -10 dB over swelling strings."

Emissive traces flow along the limbs from 20 to 60 percent brightness, micro-scratches 0.2 mm visible on metal (roughness 0.35, metalness 0.8). Energy pulsing beeps sync to his steps over an 84 BPM pulse."

Metal click at -6 dB, brief 0.1 s steam puff from the port; leather glove roughness 0.5 shows stretching as he primes the trigger."

Dragon wing flinches, entering damage Stage B while lava glow flickers on broken edges. SFX: whoosh at -5 dB, crack at -6 dB, dragon pain roar at -8 dB."

Frost volume is dense (0.6 g/m³, -40°C), forming 0.18 roughness ice while Ren slides 0.3 m into cover, cloak delayed by 0.2 s. Roaring blast at -4 dB, ice growth creaks at -7 dB."

Warm gold 4000K glow clashes against cold moonlight, gamma 1.8 contrast, visible heat distortion 1.5%. He whispers in Japanese, hum rising to -5 dB as vapor halos his face."

Finger tightens against a 1.2 N trigger pull, frost crystallizes 0.1 mm on the muzzle. Heartbeat and charging tones dominate at -15 dB bed with a soft pre-click."

Main panel shows the impact exploding in gold and orange with dense speed lines; sub-panels zoom on a contracting pupil and cracking chest glyphs. Saturation and contrast jump 20%, no depth of field, no motion blur. Onomatopoeia 'ドゴォン!!' bursts across the frame with a synced kick."

Panel edges scorch and fade as light overwhelms; CMYK dots and hard shadows retain the graphic feel before melting back to anime shading. Sound layers 'クラッシュ!!' and 'パリンッ!!' around -8 dB with a low-frequency shockwave pushing his cloak forward 0.5 m."

Cold moon key and lava bounce create gentle contrast, skin tones held warm-amber; metal surface shows 1% heat shimmer. Audio softens to -12 dB ice tinkles and -10 dB steam hiss."

Key light softens, volumetric haze thins, leaving calm air trails of 45°C cooling steam. Final 0.3 s fades to black with only distant avalanche rumble."
