  },
  "global_prompt": "Nighttime steel-vein city streets are overrun by toxic green wood fog, twisted rebar, and cold streetlamps filtering through drifting spores. Kamiya Hayato, a lean black-haired fighter in black and deep-blue techwear, wields a frost-core charger that pulses with cyan lines as he advances alone. Cameras favor stabilized dolly and low handheld accents, mixing wide spatial views with tight weapon close-ups while maintaining high contrast and cool color bias. Overall mood stays tense and decisive with crisp ice blooms, refractive mist halos, and percussive Japanese baritone cues leading each strike.",

      "time": {"start": 0.0, "end": 0.8},
      "prompt": "Top-down establishing of an empty intersection swallowed by wood fog and twisted vines, broken glass reflecting the 3600K lamps. Cold blue-green volumetric light reveals spore glints as the mist drifts under gravity. Road steel beams and cracked pavement show rough metallic PBR highlights while fog density sits around 0.35. Tension is silent and oppressive, holding the frame for the impending threat.",
      "camera": "24mm aerial dolly push 0.3 m with layered focus from foreground shards to distant haze.",
      "audio": "Low wind bed with distant monstrous echoes; clean cut to next shot."

      "time": {"start": 0.8, "end": 1.6},
      "prompt": "Wooden creatures crawl from cracks, bark roughness visible as wet vines drag across concrete. Toxic green eyes pulse every 0.4s while fog vortices spin around their nostrils. Mud splashes up to 5 cm as limbs grip the ground with friction near 0.55. Threat builds as one beast lifts its head to scent the air.",
      "camera": "35mm knee-high slider 0.5 m rightward, single-point focus on lead creature's glow.",
      "audio": "Wet creak and vine rasp with a brief hiss of spores; occlusion wipe into next frame."

      "prompt": "Hayato steps out of the haze in silhouette, shoulder carrying the frost-core charger. Backlit rim of blue light carves his outline while kicked glass arcs up 20 cm under 9.8 m/s² gravity. Techwear fabric (roughness ~0.42) sways with his steady stride. His calm focus anchors the shot as the crowding mist parts around the gun stock.",
      "camera": "50mm eye-level dolly pullback 0.6 m with 2% handheld sway, rack from fog to silhouette.",
      "audio": "Crunching glass footsteps punctuate the silence; light-match cut to the next."

      "time": {"start": 2.4, "end": 3.2},
      "prompt": "He flips his outer layer to reveal defined muscles and glowing cyan arm sigils, whispering in low Japanese. Sweat film and 0.5 mm beads catch the side-back cool light while veins rise subtly. Energy lines pulse at 2 Hz along his forearms, casting faint reflections on matte fabric (roughness ~0.36). His posture is braced, shoulders taut and eyes sharp.",
      "camera": "65mm chest-high stabilizer micro-push 0.3 m, single-point focus on pupils timed to the whisper.",

      "prompt": "Close on the frost-core charger as the charge bar jumps from 30% to 60%, cyan HUD glyphs floating without text. Frost rims the muzzle at 0.6 mm thickness, dropping surface temperature by 12°C, while the dark metal body (roughness 0.18, metalness 0.82) reflects the glow onto his tense knuckles. Pulse light flickers across veins and the trigger finger rests half-pulled. Focused determination reads in his grip and breath control.",
      "camera": "75mm prop close-up diagonal framing, slow push toward the muzzle ring.",
      "audio": "Electric hum with UI blips; light-based match cut into firing."

      "time": {"start": 4.0, "end": 4.8},
      "prompt": "Hayato snap-shots single ice rounds, muzzle trails painting thin cyan vortices. Bullet speed hits ~220 m/s while recoil drives his shoulder back 2 cm and fabric flicks 5°. Tail particles around 30 μm swirl in the damp air. His stare remains locked on target despite the controlled back-kick.",
      "camera": "50mm over-shoulder tracking 0.4 m, breathing focus from hand to trajectory with 200° shutter.",
      "audio": "Icy shriek and metallic clinks overlay the hum; direct cut into the freeze beat."

      "time": {"start": 4.8, "end": 5.6},
      "prompt": "An ice core hovers above the creature pack, then detonates in a 4 m radius bloom. Frost shock expands at 25 m/s, coating the ground in 2 mm ice at roughness 0.1 while wood bark temperatures plunge to -20°C. Cyan volumetric rays slice through the blue-white burst as spores crystallize midair. Hayato holds steady offscreen, letting the blast speak.",

      "time": {"start": 5.6, "end": 6.4},
      "prompt": "He sidesteps and fires a second shot into the frozen cluster, triggering shatter. Ice prisms refract into faint rainbows while wood shards rip outward at 15–22 m/s over slick ground with friction 0.12. Cyan highlights stay crisp against desaturated bark. Hayato compresses the rifle down, controlled and lethal.",

      "prompt": "A vine whip lashes across frame as Hayato slides sideways, sparks flaring orange from shoe friction. He fires at close range into a chest, forming a 2 mm frost plate on impact while the whip’s rough bark (0.7) flexes with elasticity 0.4. Mist and water droplets arc from his shoes in a sweeping curve. His expression stays cold, muscles tightened through the evasive motion.",
      "camera": "35mm three-quarter angle, low slider with 3% handheld shimmy, focus on impact point.",
      "audio": "Whip whoosh, fabric scrape, and sharp ice whine; whip-pan into the comic charge."

      "prompt": "He plants both feet and raises the rifle in a heroic upshot, charge bar surging 60% to 100% as he growls \"終わりだ\". Stylized speed lines in cyan, magenta, and white radiate behind him while the muzzle frosts to -25°C and veins bulge 1.5 mm. Cyan bloom floods his shoulders with subtle SSS glow. Emotion shifts to explosive resolve.",

      "prompt": "Overhead view as the giant ice core slams into the pack center, shockwave racing outward. A 10 m ring of frost thickens to 6 mm while compressed air forms a translucent halo wall. Wood forms freeze and fracture simultaneously, shards flinging at ~28 m/s. The streetlights bloom briefly under the cold blast.",
      "camera": "24mm top-down with 5% digital zoom, focus rolling from blast center to rim at 200° shutter.",

      "time": {"start": 8.8, "end": 9.6},
      "prompt": "Slow-motion close on a front creature as its chest erupts, wood and ice fragments spinning outward. Chips sized 2–15 mm tumble at 12 m/s while prisms refract a 22° rainbow glint. Background drops to soft desaturation so the icy shards stay luminous. No characters on screen, only the beauty of the shatter.",
      "camera": "75mm chest-high locked frame at 48fps conformed to 24fps, focus on fracture center, 144° shutter.",

      "prompt": "Stabilized pan sweeps 120° across a street now frozen solid, ice sculptures of fallen beasts glinting. Glossy ice (roughness 0.1) mirrors the 3600K lamps while wind at 2.5 m/s pushes mist to the right. One sculpture wobbles and crumbles into 5–10 cm blocks. The scene feels eerily calm after the onslaught.",

Cold backlight from streetlamps silhouettes his shoulders and techwear folds as condensation beads 0.2 mm across the metal. Fabric rebounds over 0.05 s after the action, hinting at fatigue yet vigilance. A short murmur escapes in Japanese.",

Hair strands shift 2 mm in the breeze and a simple necklace swings at 2 Hz. Background street stays blurred in blue mist while a subtle pull-back freezes for the last 0.2 s, ideal for a thumbnail. His expression holds cold resolve and readiness for more.",
