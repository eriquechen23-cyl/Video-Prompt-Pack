  "global_prompt": "Night in a neon-splintered lower-city alley soaked with puddles and thin white mist; fractured signs cast cyan and magenta reflections over wet steel plates. Retsu, a short-haired athletic fighter in a black tactical suit traced by pulsing red circuit glyphs, wields slim red-etched daggers that power shadow-step strikes. Swarms of small shadow creatures of black fog and bone spikes crawl from drains and wall cracks, eyes glowing dull amber. Camera favors slider moves and low handheld under 3%, with crisp depth cues through volumetric haze and tight red-black contrast building to an explosive radial finisher.",

      "time": {"start": 0.0, "end": 1.25},
      "prompt": "High aerial tilt down over the lower-city alley packed with cyan and magenta neon shards reflecting in shallow puddles while thin white fog layers drift. Distant shadow growls pulse from far below as the shot descends 2m, revealing wet metal plates vibrating lightly. Volumetric haze catches light, keeping the frame empty of text or signage.",
      "camera": "24mm overhead slide downward, soft descent on rails",
      "motion": "Slow vertical glide with subtle environmental tremor",
      "audio": "Hollow ambience, metallic drips, far-off creature rumble"

      "id": "S02",
      "time": {"start": 1.25, "end": 2.5},
      "prompt": "Side mid shot as Retsu steps from shadow into the alley center; black suit clings to defined shoulders while red energy seams pulse faintly. Boots slap through puddles sending 2–4 mm droplets at a 35° arc; reflections ripple around him. Cool-blue rim mixes with warm red glints on his collarbones, stance tight and controlled.",
      "camera": "32mm side dolly push 1m with minimal handheld",
      "motion": "Gentle forward creep tracking his stride",

      "time": {"start": 2.5, "end": 3.75},
      "prompt": "Tight hand close-up as multiple slim daggers spin between his fingers and split, edges glowing with dark-red energy veins. Background auto-dims to isolate chrome highlights and faint red mist warped by blade wake; rotation shows fingerprint sheen on knuckles. His quiet Japanese murmur rides over crisp metallic chimes.",
      "camera": "40mm close-up locked on blade backs with shallow DOF",
      "motion": "Micro orbit around the hand to follow spin",

      "prompt": "Back-facing mid shot: Retsu anchors in foreground while drains and wall cracks ahead leak black fog as small shadow creatures crawl out, their amber eye dots igniting in clusters. Slight handheld shake mirrors ground vibration and concentric ripples in puddles. Neon reflections smear across the fog, heightening threat.",
      "camera": "32mm rear mid with 3% handheld, focus racks to swarm",
      "motion": "Static hold with minor quake as creatures emerge",

      "prompt": "Slow-motion tracking of the first dagger whipping forward, trailing a red-black streak toward the swarm core. Blade glints show Retsu’s calm eyes reflected as neon stretches into ribbons. Impact lands center mass with a sharp ping while bone spikes crack into 1–3 mm shards.",

      "time": {"start": 6.25, "end": 7.5},
      "prompt": "At the dagger’s landing point the frame flashes black-red as Retsu shadow-steps in, waist-led rotation driving a half-moon punch that detonates a red energy arc. Black fog peels back at 6 m/s, shards obey gravity, and fabric snaps before settling. Muscles coil and release with a taut exhale.",
      "camera": "45mm mid-close waist-up with light handheld",

      "prompt": "Oblique top view of the alley mapped with multiple red marker points; Retsu teleports between them in rapid beats delivering airborne kick, wallside elbow, and crossed dual slash. Each move leaves 1 m red-black afterimages and sprays mist into diagonal lines. Neon and red glints weave across the shadow field.",
      "camera": "28mm high three-quarter with 1m lift on rail",

Red energy floods down his leg; fabric stretch snaps back with a 0.1s delay. Water sprays up 0.6 m with gritty droplets.",

Blades hover 0.8–1.5 m high, spinning at 12 rev/s while fog funnels inward and puddles draw centripetal ripples. Red runes flare to eye-searing brightness.",

      "prompt": "Flash-cut to the ring center as Retsu appears, arms crossed on his chest while background briefly flips to monochrome speed lines like a manga panel. Daggers hang in pause, red light outlining his forearms and sweat sheen. He inhales, eyes razor sharp, charging for the release.",
      "camera": "65mm static then subtle push 1m toward face",
      "motion": "Strobe-like entry then slow push under high contrast",
      "audio": "Music ducks for 0.2s, metallic resonance, shouted cue"

      "prompt": "Retsu snaps his arms open; daggers burst outward in a radial blast, briefly rendered in bold comic panels before returning to full color. Shockwave expands at ~18 m/s erasing creatures into fine black-gray dust and whipping water into a circular spray. Red and neon mix then fade back to normal as debris rains.",

Mid to close angles show Retsu steadying his breath, red glyphs dimming to faint traces as he turns and walks deeper into the alley. Final pullback lingers on a broken blade reflecting neon in the puddle before fade out.",
